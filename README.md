This project makes it easy to develop JS and CSS on wiki/fandom (cause doing it in a "native" way totally sucks: loading/edit/refreshing wiki pages all day long take ages)

Just use `npm run watch` and you're good to go !

On each save, all your files will be compiled, minified, pushed and ready on your wiki !
